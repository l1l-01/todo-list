Rust Todo List Application :

This is a simple command-line Todo List application written in Rust. It allows users to add tasks, remove tasks, view all tasks, and save them to a file.

Features :

Add new tasks
Remove existing tasks
View all tasks
Persistent storage using a text file

Requirements :

Rust programming language

Usage :

The application presents a menu with the following options:
1- Add a new task
2- Remove a task
3- Show tasks
4- Quit

Enter the number corresponding to the action you want to perform and follow the prompts.

File Storage :

The application uses a file named todoapp.txt in the same directory as the executable to store tasks. This file is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

Note :

This is a basic implementation and does not include error handling for all possible scenarios. It's recommended to add more robust error handling and input validation for production use.
